## Why We're Here

Gay Asians and Pacific Islanders represent a unique “double minority” population in many western countries---as gaysians, we are not only a minority in ethnic background but also in sexual orientation. Growing up and dealing with both institutionalized discrimination and the stigma against homosexuality can be an incredibly challenging and isolating experience. Unlike many of our friends who do not share the same minority status, many gaysians lack proper role models to learn from at a critical time during the development of their self-identities. In fact, for the vast majority, our first contacts with other gaysians and gay social groups are facilitated through dating apps and the clubbing/raving scenes. Yet too often, the apps and gay venues are platforms that prioritize physical beauty, instant gratification, objectification, and sexual prowess at the expense of deeper and longer-lasting connections.

In light of this reality, we decided to create the Gaysian Third Space (G3S), an alternative global platform for individuals looking for Community. A Community that is a safe and supportive environment where members encourage each other to grow and mature as they explore their identities. A Community where we can share our stories and struggles on coming out, family, school/career, romance, body image, relationships, and other experiences that perhaps only fellow gaysians can fully understand. A Community that gives voice to our “multiple minority” experiences on timely issues, because our perspectives are valid and deserve to be heard. That is our vision for Gaysian Third Space.
