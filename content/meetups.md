G3S has facilitated meetups all around the world! Our regional chapters in North America organize official social events, and we've also had informal meetups where people hang out together after meeting through G3S's Tumblr, Facebook, or LINE Chat Group. Traveling somewhere and want to get to know some local G3S members? Contact the regional chapters below and get connected!

## Upcoming Meetups
{{< /anchor >}}

When we plan official meetups, we announce them on our Tumblr blog and our Facebook page:

<div id="fb-root"></div>
<script>(function(d, s, id) {
  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10";
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>

<div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/gaysianthirdspace/" data-tabs="events" data-width="500" data-height="500" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="false"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/gaysianthirdspace/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaysianthirdspace/">Gaysian Third Space - G3S</a></blockquote></div>

Unofficial meetups are usually coordinated informally in our [LINE Chat Group](/programs/#linechat).
