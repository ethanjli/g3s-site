G3S has facilitated meetups all around the world! Our regional chapters in North America organize official social events, and we've also had informal meetups where people hang out together after connecting through G3S's Tumblr, Facebook, or LINE Chat Group. Traveling somewhere and want to meet some local G3S members? Contact the regional chapters below and get connected!

In addition to building regional chapters, we are also collaborating with some existing API queer organizations with community-building programs:

- Asian and Pacific Islander Queers United for Action ([AQUA](http://www.aquadc.us)), Washington DC
- Gay Asian Pacific Islander Men of New York ([GAPIMNY](http://gapimny.org)), New York City

When we plan official meetups, we usually announce them on our Tumblr blog and our Facebook page:

<div id="fb-root"></div>
<script>(function(d, s, id) {
  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10";
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>

<div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/gaysianthirdspace/" data-tabs="events" data-width="500" data-height="500" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="false"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/gaysianthirdspace/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaysianthirdspace/">Gaysian Third Space - G3S</a></blockquote></div>

Unofficial meetups are coordinated informally in our [LINE Chat Group](/programs/#linechat).
