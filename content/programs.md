One of the main missions at G3S is to create a supportive gaysian community and foster mentorship and friendship as we explore our identities. To fulfill this mission, we started by creating a **Tumblr blog** to share and archive content relevant to our community. To facilitate closer interactions, we created a **LINE chat group** for chatting and more casual conversation. In addition to these platforms, we have created a **mentorship program** for people to interact and learn from each other in an even smaller group setting. We are continuing to develop our initiatives—including our **Follower Friday** and **Writer's Roundtable** series, [**local meetups**](/meetups), and our **Mental Health Project**—to better meet the needs of our community.

If you have any questions, or if you’re interested in getting involved in any of our initiatives, please [send us a message](/contact)!

{{< content-header linechat fa-comments >}}LINE Chat Group{{< /content-header >}}

We have a chat group on LINE to facilitate chatting, serious discussions, and more casual conversations across many time zones. LINE group moderators (Fish and Jeff from the [G3S Team](/about#team)) work actively to moderate membership and monitor the chat to maintain a supportive and welcoming environment for all of the participants.

To join the LINE group, please follow these instructions:

1. Fill out the [sign-up form](//docs.google.com/forms/d/1et74jeWtk1F0Q667p-cWpZLmKaWFN0FJyHZ-_M9kHVs/edit) here (this step is required).
2. [Download and install](//line.me/en/download) the LINE app.
3. Wait for “alostfish” to send you a message on LINE. If he doesn't contact you within two days, please send him a friend request and a message.

Please review and commit to following our LINE Group [community guidelines](//docs.google.com/document/d/1bPTXCXAYPnEbOu428BZbERMQEdl5_RKLLNzAM3RuwK4/edit?usp=sharing). We look forward to welcoming you to the group!

{{< content-header blog fa-tumblr >}}Tumblr Blog{{< /content-header >}}

Our [Tumblr blog](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com) curates stories, posts, articles, and discussions so that we can learn from each other's experiences and thoughts. We are always seeking new contributors and content, so please [submit](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/submit) any posts, new or old, that you think could fit this mission. We also regularly invite members of our community to guest curate our blog, where they showcase content matching a theme of their choice for a week.

Finally, we are [cataloging](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tags) our archives to make it easier to find content that speaks to specific topics and experiences.

If you'd prefer to follow us on WordPress, we maintain a mirror of our Tumblr blog [here](//gaysianthirdspacev2.wordpress.com/).

{{< content-header mentorship fa-envelope-open >}}Mentorship Program{{< /content-header >}}

We understand that people who are just beginning to explore their identities can get overwhelmed with large, fast-paced group chats. Sometimes it is challenging to summon the courage to message unfamiliar people. The **G3S Mentors Program** addresses this need. Our goal is to expand our directory of volunteer mentors (like RAs for new freshman in a college dorm) who would be willing to engage and interact with existing or new G3S members in a one-on-one or small group setting.

If you would like to sign up as a **mentor**, please fill out [this form](//docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2FvWZ0IQhHNVpH4L05bPFnX3Bl8C-1fW7pntc52HxIieY0g/viewform?c=0&w=1).

If you would like to sign up as a **mentee**, please fill out [this form](//docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdyfccqu3Ngg18KvDpURP_LCmTArBQgBlslHLyjo6SXTXICqg/viewform?c=0&w=1).

{{< content-header followers fa-address-card >}}Follower Friday{{< /content-header >}}

We run a [Follower Fridays series](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/followerfriday) to showcase the diversity of gaysians and to get to know each other better by featuring the profile of a member of our community every Friday on our [blog](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com) and our [Instagram account](//www.instagram.com/gaysianthirdspace/).

{{< content-header writersroundtable fa-pencil >}}Writer's Roundtable{{< /content-header >}}

We run a [Writer’s Roundtable series](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/askG3S/chrono) to facilitate and publish conversations on topics of interest to the community. If you have any topics you’d like the writers in our community to discuss, please [submit](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/writers-roundtable) them to the Writer’s Roundtable!

{{< content-header mentalhealth fa-life-ring >}}Mental Health Project{{< /content-header >}}

We are working to create resources to support mental health for queer API people, in order to help meet the needs of members of the G3S community and queer API communities more broadly. We are currently investigating how we might best leverage our collective knowledge and resources to meet the needs of our communities. If you are interested in collaborating, sharing notes, or chatting with us about queer API mental health, we'd love to talk to you! Just [send us a message](/contact) and we will follow up with you.

{{< content-header socialmedia fa-facebook >}}Social Media{{< /content-header >}}

We are exploring other platforms for engagement and story-sharing by maintaining the following pages:

* An [Instagram account](//www.instagram.com/gaysianthirdspace/) for sharing our experiences and learning from each other through a more visual medium. We are starting by sharing our Follower Friday profiles on the account, and we hope to eventually provide a community platform for visual storytelling.
* A [Facebook page](//www.facebook.com/gaysianthirdspace) for facilitating more interactive discussions about the content posted to the Tumblr blog.
