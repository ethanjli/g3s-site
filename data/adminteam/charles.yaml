  Diaries](http://gaysiandiaries.com/), a Tumblr site he made for queer Asian Pacific
  Islander men and transgender people to share and reflect upon their experiences.
  He also serves as the Chair of [GAPIMNY](http://gapimny.org/) and hopes to help
  foster long-lasting partnerships amongst QTAPI groups around the world. In his free
  time, he enjoys intense workouts, meditating, and trying new restaurants.
