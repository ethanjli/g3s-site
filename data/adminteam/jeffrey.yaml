text: 'Jeffrey is a co-founder of G3S, the culmination of many discussions on creating
  an inclusive, nonjudgmental space for queer Asians to foster genuine and meaningful
  connections. Today, Jeffrey’s responsibilities include managing the [Tumblr blog](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com),
  compiling [Follower Friday profiles](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/followerfriday),
  matchmaking for the [Mentorship program](/programs#mentorship),
  and organizing the [Writer’s Roundtable](//gaysianthirdspace.tumblr.com/tagged/askG3S/chrono).
  He’s also very excited about the [Mental Health project](/programs/#mentalhealth)
  and is looking forward to developing that resource further. Jeffrey is a third-generation
  Chinese American from San Francisco and currently based in the Washington, D.C. metro area
  where he works as an environmental economist for the federal government. When found
  in moments of relaxation, he is often singing/playing the piano, eating and cooking, or indulging in digital card games.'
